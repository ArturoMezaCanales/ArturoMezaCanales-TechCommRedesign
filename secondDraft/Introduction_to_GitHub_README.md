## 🔧 What Is Git and GitHub?

### Git
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that helps developers:
- Track changes in their code
- Collaborate with others
- Revert to previous versions when needed

### GitHub
GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that builds on Git, allowing users to:
- Share and manage projects
- Store repositories online
- Use features like pull requests, issues, and project boards

Whether you're analyzing data or building games, GitHub is a great tool to collaborate with others.

## 📘 Key GitHub Concepts

### 🔸 Repositories
Repositories act as a centralized place to store all your project files and their entire history. They support:
- Code files, associated files & documentation
- Version control, to change back to previous versions
- Collaboration with other GitHub accounts

🔗 [Learn more about Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories)

### 🔸 Branches
Branches let you work on new features or fixes without affecting the main project.
- Create with `git branch feature-branch`
- Switch with `git checkout feature-branch`
- Merge when ready (look at pull request section)

🔗 [About Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches)

### 🔸 Forks
Forking creates a personal copy of someone else’s project so you can experiment without affecting the original.

🔗 [Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

### 🔸 Pull Requests
Suggest changes from your branch back to the main project. Use pull requests to:
- Request reviews
- Start discussions
- Merge your work

🔗 [About Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### 🔸 Issues
Track bugs, tasks, or ideas. Issues help organize work and facilitate communication.

🔗 [About Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

### 🔸 Markdown
Style your text with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Use it to:
- Format README files
- Enhance issues and pull requests
- Add links, lists, images, and more

## 🔁 GitHub Workflow Overview

### 1. Repositories
Your project's home base. A repository contains:
- Files and folders
- Change history
- Collaboration tools

You can work privately or invite collaborators.

### 2. Cloning
Copy a repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
This lets you edit code offline and use your favorite tools. Learn more: [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### 3. Committing & Pushing
- **Commit**: Save a checkpoint of your changes
- **Push**: Send those changes to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
git push origin your-branch
```
